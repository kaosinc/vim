## General
This is a simple project to create a vim setup that can be downloaded and used anywhere. It is intended to be super basic. At some point I may switch from using multiple editors to just using VIM (maybe), so I'll be experimenting with VIM a lot and updating it. Oh yeah I stumbled upon Pathogen, I use that to install/load vim plugins/tools.

## Install
- clone the repo
- cd vim
- cp -rf .vim ~
- cp .vimrc ~

## Pathogen Bundles Installed
- vim-airline: Shows a nice statusline at the bottom of each window, there are many other features.
- ansible-vim: syntax.
- vim-terraform: symtax.
