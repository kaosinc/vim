## General
This is a "test project" to setup a Github repo. It is intended to be super basic, however at some point I may switch from using multiple editors to just using Vim, so I'll be experimenting with it a lot.

## Bundles
- vim-airline: Shows a nice statusline at the bottom of each window, there are many other features.

## Caveats
- The .git sub-dir for bundles has been removed ... this is bad (probably).
