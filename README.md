## General
This is a simple project to create a vim setup that can be downloaded and used anywhere. It is intended to be super basic. At some point I may switch from using multiple editors to just using VIM (maybe), so I'll be experimenting with VIM a lot and updating it.

## Install
- clone the repo
- cd vim
- cp -rf .vim ~
- cp -rf .vimrc ~

## Pathogen Bundles Installed
- vim-airline: Shows a nice statusline at the bottom of each window, there are many other features.
- ansible-vim: linter
- NERDTree: file viewer.
- vim-terraform.

## Comments (Rambles)
- NERDTree is the bomb, .vimrc has an entry in it to enable mouse support.
